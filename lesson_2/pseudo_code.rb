# 1. a method that returns the sum of two integers
# Given 2 integers
# perform sum operation btween them
# output the result
#Formal:
# START
# Given 2 integers 
# SET result = sum of the 2 integers
# PRINT result
# END

# 2. a method that takes an array of strings, and returns a string
# that is all those strings concatenated together
# Given an array of strings
# concatenate all the strings in the array
# output result
#Formal:
# START
# Given an array of strings called "strings"
# SET concatenated_string = values in the array concatanated 
# PRINT concatenated_string
# END

# 3. a method that takes and array of integers, and returns a new
# array whith every other element
# Given an array of integers
# iterate through the array
# save all positions in even numbers from the array in a variable
# return the new variable
#Formal:
# START
# Give and array of integers
# SET every_other_value = [] (empty array)
# WHILE iterator <= length of give array
#   IF index of current array is even
#     SET add the value in that position to every_other_value
#     ELSE go to next iteration
#
# PRINT every_other_value
# END
